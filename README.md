1. The `main` method sets up the necessary variables and arrays.
2. It prompts the user to generate a random sentence.
3. It uses a `while` loop to continuously generate sentences until the user terminates the program.
4. Inside the loop, it calls the `getRandomWord` method to get a random word from the specified array.
5. It prints the sentence with the randomly chosen words.
6. It prompts the user to generate a new random sentence.
